Notes for proof that every hamiltonian cycle on the grid can be represented as the outline of a tree covering the entire area on the grid.

---

Desired properties of cycle:

On every gridpoint in rectanglar region on the grid. All segments axis aligned, all nodes on gridpoint.

---

1: Prove that every outline of a tree on the grid that touches every node in a rectangular region in this grid is a valid hamiltonian cycle on a grid with twice the resolution and shifted by half a step in both axes.

Tree doesn't contain cycles, therefore resulting outline is a single cycle.

Outline touches every grid point in scaled/shifted grid. (include sketch of possible gridpoint configurations)

Outline is always axis aligned, doesn't have corners that aren't on a gridpoint.

---

2: (additional) Prove that every hamiltonian cycle can be generated by this method:

(Essentially find a bijection between hamiltonian cycles and the trees. Maybe we can show that the number of cycles is less than or equal to the number of trees and use the injectivity of our conversion, although counting solutions is hard..)

Find the inverse of the above conversion and show that it is defined on every possible cycle.

Cycle is only possible for 2n * 2m grid graphs

Flood fill cycle, check if it corresponds to valid tree.

---

A proof that the random mst method can generate every possible tree in the grid is obvious, by taking the tree and constructing the graph weights such that this tree is the mst of the graph.
